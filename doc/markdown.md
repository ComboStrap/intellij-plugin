# Markdown


## FlexMark
https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java
flexmark-java is a Java implementation of CommonMark (spec 0.28) parser using the blocks first,
inlines after Markdown parsing architecture.

It is a fork of [commonmark-java project](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java), modified to generate an AST which reflects all the elements in the original source, full source position tracking for all elements in the AST and easier JetBrains Open API PsiTree generation.

## Gfm

The [lexer code](https://github.com/JetBrains/markdown/blob/master/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/intellij/markdown/flavours/gfm/lexer/_GFMLexer.kt) was generated by JFlex 1.7.0 tweaked for IntelliJ platform


## CommonMark parsing

Any lines not claimed by some block parser are claimed by the core ParagraphParser.

Pass to the active component the start of the line for space/indentation processing (creating an indentation token) 
Pass to the component the fact that this is a start line (for block indentation based on space)

Disable block indentation based on space by default

Allow or disallow p inside a mode
